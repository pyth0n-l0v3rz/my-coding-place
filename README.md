Welcome to my corner of the internet. I'm from _netsa_, a place where curiosity fuels every line of code and where learning never really stops. This space is where I tinker with ideas, break things on purpose (and sometimes not on purpose), and occasionally build something that actually works.

Most of what you’ll find here are random bits of code, half-finished tools, experiments gone sideways, and the occasional late-night masterpiece. It’s chaotic, it’s raw, but it’s mine.

People always ask why I write so much code that never sees the light of day. Truth is, it’s not always about finishing — sometimes it’s about the journey, the logic puzzles, the debugging at 3 a.m., and that one moment when you finally realize — _y0u_ were looking at the wrong file the whole time.

Along the way, I’ve _f0und_ that the best way to learn is to get lost — deep in documentation, buried in error logs, tangled in version control. It’s frustrating, but also kinda beautiful in its own way.

And if you’ve made it this far through the rambling, maybe you get it too. Maybe this whole thing isn’t just a GitHub repo — maybe it’s a scavenger hunt for people like us. People who see code not just as syntax, but as a story.

Anyway, hope you find something useful here — or at least something weird enough to remember. And if you're sharp enough, you might notice that you just found _1t_.
